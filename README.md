# ReadMe Generator

## Description

My motivation for the following project was to build a readme generator. Constructing a readme generator is helpful for many coders since it is a typical interview project. This project helped me learn javascript, npm, and node. I built this project to test my javascript skills and learn more about coding. One of the major struggles I had with this readme generator was taking and uploading the recording. I used GeForce Experience to record my video.
